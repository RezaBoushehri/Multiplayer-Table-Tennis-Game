Multiplayer Table Tennis Game
A real-time multiplayer ping-pong game built to explore HTML Canvas and WebSockets. This project was created to gain a deeper understanding of game development in the browser, real-time communication using WebSockets, and the fundamentals of drawing and animating on the HTML5 Canvas.

HTML Canvas is used to draw the game elements (ball, paddles, etc.) and animate them during gameplay.
Socket.io enables real-time communication between the server and the clients (players). When a player moves, the server updates the game state and broadcasts the changes to both players.
The game logic includes ball physics, paddle movement, and scorekeeping. The game ends when one player reaches 10 points.

Future Improvements
Add more customization options like different paddles, ball sizes, or power-ups.
Implement a matchmaking system for better player-room assignment.
Add sounds for in-game events such as ball hits and scoring.
Implement AI so that players can play against the computer.
